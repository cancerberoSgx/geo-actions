/* 
'navigator' is a feature oriented to the final persona. 

Example: put earphones, enter the app, start walking on a building, app will change audio tracks while he enter rooms

It uses the same model as the rest, given by polygonmanager

it needs to be genneric enough to be extendable to support: 

 * action: sound, picture, request, etc
 * location-activation: the algorithm for changing the action 

should support sub-utilities for better experience like map showing in google/canvas diagram
