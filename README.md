## Demo: polygon and documents editor

Just enter here, create a document and then polygons inside it:
https://cancerberosgx.github.io/geo-actions/index.html#documentList

## Development

Tools neccesary to install in orther to change this app:

    sudo npm install -g uglify-js watchify browserify

Build and run the developer tools with :
    
    sh build.sh & 
    firefox index-dev.html

The idea is to facilitate programs that I've seen in some museums where an autio-guide device change the track automatically by detecting changes in your geo-position. Right now just a proof of concept.
